Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `Control-Yourself` for local development.

1. Fork the `Control-Yourself` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:MadhavBahlMD/Control-Yourself.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper
   installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv deezer-python
    $ cd Control-Yourself/
    $ npm install

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. Commit your changes, quoting github issue in the commit message, if applicable
   and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Fix #XX - My awesome fix"
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests for feature or bug fixes.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. If your change is worthwhile a mention in the changelog, update the
   Unreleased section of HISTORY.rst
